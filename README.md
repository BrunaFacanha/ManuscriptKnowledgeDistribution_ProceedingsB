# ManuscriptKnowledgeDistribution_ProceedingsB

ARTICLE INFORMATION: Using 14,827 occurrence records and machine learning, we mapped knowledge distribution at three levels (two taxonomic and one comparative) for sarcosaprophagous flies in the Brazilian Amazon: families, the best-sampled species, and a null model simulating the probability of knowledge by chance. These flies have high ecological and public health relevance, and our results reveal substantial and notable gaps in knowledge about them. These patterns were consistent across all taxonomic levels, highlighting that addressing knowledge biases requires more than simply increasing research effort. Our findings emphasize the importance of studying less charismatic groups, such as sarcosaprophagous flies, which are essential for ecosystem functioning. We provide new insights into the value of targeted surveys in remote areas and collaborative engagement with local traditional communitiesâ€”both essential for building a comprehensive understanding of biodiversity and promoting effective conservation in the Amazon.

REPOSITORY CONTENTS:
>> Null_model_sort.R: Contains the code for Amazon grid creation, random point selection, and generation of a random occurrence database, used to produce the null (chance) knowledge model.

>> knowledge_distribution_models.R: Contains the code to generate the 19 Random Forest models and results (3 at the family level, 15 at the species level, and 1 null model).

>> Figures_knowledge_distribution.R: Contains the code to produce the figures presented in the article. All figures were finalized in Photoshop Inkscape to add fly illustrations.
